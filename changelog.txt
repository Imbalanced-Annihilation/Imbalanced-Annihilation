Imbalanced Annihilation v1.0.0
(Balanced Annihilation Mod by Krogoth)

*** WIP ***

New units:

ARM Meerkat - Stealthy Bomber Kbot (Tier 1)
Cheap, can take advantage of radar-invisibility and short but unobstructed vision.
Gains damage when levels up.
// it has mediocre velocity, weak armor and generally (very) bad at hitting maneuverable targets
// would be interesting to see how this unit might turn useful
// note that if group of such units raids successfully, they can level up fast and sustain about the same DPS despite casualties

ARM Wasp - Resurrection/Reclaim/Repair Plane (Tier 1 Aircraft)
Repairs twice as fast as construction aircraft and is more durable.
// gives another way to support your team when going air

Replaced HLLT with CORE Immolator - Fire Barrier Cannon
Rapidly fires in line, repelling hit enemies.
Takes 120 energy to sustain.
// want to see more pushing mechanics, as a notable property of weapon

CORE Scarfing - Salvo Rocket Launcher (Tier 1 Vehicle)
Large but highly mobile vehicle that can bombard area with 18 missiles in a row.
Requires manual command and cannot move (nor stop) while fires.
Deals most damage to tanks and least to structures.
// this is something that is highly dependent on control
// one scarfing is easy to avoid but a few can make a wall of fire or take a bunch of tanks clumped onto each other
// since it is fast, probably the best way to kill it is while it fires

Reworked CORE Intruder. It is now a Tier 1 Amphibious Transport Truck.
Can load up to 7 units 2x2 with total mass of 1100 or 1 Commander.
Has 1100 radar range, costs 450 metal.
Automatically unloads 1 unit before it is killed. (Commander is always unloaded)
Adjusted mass of Commanders and Decoy Commanders: 5000->1100 (crushResistance->5000).
// load/unload mechanics is far from great though :S
// for now it cannot transport nano towers

CORE Proteus - Support Assault Tank (Tier 2)
Armed with laser that out-ranges most mobile units but has little DPS.
However, it pierces through units, that can multiply its effectiveness against group of units or large sized units.
Has 700 sight range.
// against small units it is about the same DPS as Instigator
// against big Tier 2 units the damage can be multiplied up to a point you might call decent
// combat usage of such tanks is justified if they can sit behind and provide DPS, since they do not cost much

ARM Ragnarok - Very Heavy Gauss Tank (Tier 2)
Expensive and vulnerable tank with decent velocity and very high DPS short range cannon.
Pierces and damages all objects in line similar to D-Gun.
Has big death explosion.
Cannot be transported.
// would be interesting to see if this DPS can be delivered on practice :S


Replaced Floating Radars with Sonars
// to buff amphibious attacks

Removed Hardened Metal and Energy Storages
// to make such type of buildings vulnerable at all stages

For this version (might be temporarily), removed Garpike, Parrow and Gun Platforms
