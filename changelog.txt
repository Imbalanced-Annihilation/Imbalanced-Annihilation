*** WIP ***

First to say, I've imported some icons from OTA. Tell me if you like it.
I've made it (and some other choices) because I personally think they are preferable (no retro feelings here).

GROUND / HOVER:
---------------
*NEW* ARM Meerkat - Stealthy Bomber Kbot (Tier 1)
Cheap kbot that can take advantage of radar-invisibility and short but unobstructed vision.
Has weak armor and is generally (very) bad at hitting maneuverable targets.
Gains damage when levels up.
// Would be interesting to see how this unit might turn useful.

Replaced HLLT with CORE Immolator - Fire Barrier Cannon
Rapidly fires in line, repelling hit enemies.
Takes 120 energy to sustain.
// Would like to see more pushing mechanics as a notable thing.

*NEW* CORE Scarfing - Salvo Rocket Launcher (Tier 1 Vehicle)
Large but highly mobile vehicle that can bombard area with 18 missiles in a row.
Requires manual command and cannot move (nor stop) while it fires.
Deals most damage to tanks and least to structures.
// This is something highly dependent on control.
// 1 Scarfing is generally easy to avoid but a few can make a wall of fire or take a bunch of tanks clumped onto each other.
// Because it is fast, probably the best way to kill it is while it fires.

Reworked CORE Intruder. It is now a Tier 1 Amphibious Transport Truck.
Can load up to 7 units 2x2 with total mass of 1100 or 1 Commander.
Has 1100 radar range, costs 450 metal.
Automatically unloads 1 unit before it is killed. (Commander is always unloaded)
Adjusted mass of Commanders and Decoy Commanders: 5000->1100 (crushResistance->5000).
// Load/unload mechanics is far from great though. :S
// For now it cannot transport Nano Towers.

*NEW* CORE Proteus - Support Assault Tank (Tier 2)
Armed with laser that out-ranges most mobile units but has little DPS.
However, it pierces through units, that can multiply its effectiveness against group of units or large sized units.
Has 700 sight range.

*NEW* ARM Ragnarok - Very Heavy Gauss Tank (Tier 2)
Expensive and vulnerable tank with decent velocity and very high DPS short range cannon.
Pierces and damages all objects in line similar to D-Gun.
Has big death explosion.
Cannot be transported.
// Would be interesting to see if this DPS can be delivered on practice. :S

Removed Hardened Metal and Energy Storages
// (to make such type of buildings vulnerable at all stages)
