*** WIP ***

First to say, I've imported some icons from OTA. Tell me if you like it.
I've made it (and some other choices) because I personally think they are preferable (no retro feelings here).

NEW UNITS:
----------
ARM Meerkat - Stealthy Bomber Kbot (Tier 1)
Cheap kbot that can take advantage of radar-invisibility and short but unobstructed vision.
Has weak armor and is generally (very) bad at hitting maneuverable targets.
Gains damage when levels up.
// Would be interesting to see how this unit might turn useful.

ARM Wasp - Resurrection/Reclaim/Repair Plane (Tier 1 Aircraft)
Repairs twice as fast as construction aircraft and is more durable.
// Gives another way to support the team if going air.

Replaced HLLT with CORE Immolator - Fire Barrier Cannon
Rapidly fires in line, repelling hit enemies.
Takes 120 energy to sustain.
// Would like to see more pushing mechanics as a notable thing.

CORE Scarfing - Salvo Rocket Launcher (Tier 1 Vehicle)
Large but highly mobile vehicle that can bombard area with 18 missiles in a row.
Requires manual command and cannot move (nor stop) while it fires.
Deals most damage to tanks and least to structures.
// This is something highly dependent on control.
// 1 Scarfing is generally easy to avoid but a few can make a wall of fire or take a bunch of tanks clumped onto each other.
// Because it is fast, probably the best way to kill it is while it fires.

Reworked CORE Intruder. It is now a Tier 1 Amphibious Transport Truck.
Can load up to 7 units 2x2 with total mass of 1100 or 1 Commander.
Has 1100 radar range, costs 450 metal.
Automatically unloads 1 unit before it is killed. (Commander is always unloaded)
Adjusted mass of Commanders and Decoy Commanders: 5000->1100 (crushResistance->5000).
// Load/unload mechanics is far from great though. :S
// For now it cannot transport Nano Towers.

CORE Proteus - Support Assault Tank (Tier 2)
Armed with laser that out-ranges most mobile units but has little DPS.
However, it pierces through units, that can multiply its effectiveness against group of units or large sized units.
Has 700 sight range.

ARM Ragnarok - Very Heavy Gauss Tank (Tier 2)
Expensive and vulnerable tank with decent velocity and very high DPS short range cannon.
Pierces and damages all objects in line similar to D-Gun.
Has big death explosion.
Cannot be transported.
// Would be interesting to see if this DPS can be delivered on practice. :S

CHANGES:
--------
Replaced Floating Radars with Sonars
// (to buff amphibious attacks)
